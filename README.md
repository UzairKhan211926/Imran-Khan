## Features:

### UI/UX:

#### 1. Colour Scheme
- This website has a constant color theme running through all the links. For example, in the main content: light blue and silver. The reference block is grey, and the background is white throughout.
- The font for the body is Arial with a fallback on sans-serif.

#### 2. Typography

##### 1. Readability and Accessibility:
- Arial is a widely recognized and legible font. It ensures that the content on the website is easy to read for most users, including those with visual impairments or using different devices.

##### 2. Consistency and Universality:
- Arial is a default font available on most operating systems and browsers. This ensures consistent rendering across different platforms, minimizing the risk of font rendering issues that might arise with less universally supported fonts.

##### 3. Professional and Modern Appearance:
- Arial is a sans-serif font known for its clean and modern appearance. It conveys a professional look suitable for a website dedicated to a public figure like Imran Khan.

##### 4. Fallback for Compatibility:
- Using "sans-serif" as a fallback ensures that if Arial is not available on a user's system, the browser will default to another sans-serif font that is available. This maintains the overall design integrity and readability of the website.

##### 5. Load Time Considerations:
- Arial is a commonly used font and may already be cached in users' browsers, potentially reducing load times compared to less common or custom fonts.

In summary, choosing Arial with a fallback on sans-serif fonts strikes a balance between readability, accessibility, compatibility, and aesthetic appeal, making it a sensible choice for a website about Imran Khan or any similar public figure.

### Existing Features:

#### 1. Navigation Bar 
- Along with the name of the website, the navigation bar includes links to all the pages of the website, i.e., Home, PTI, SKCMH & Namal College.
- Through the navigation bar, the user can easily move around and take full advantage of all the features provided by the website. For user convenience, I also fixed the navigation bar so users can switch between the links without the need to scroll up to the top every time.

##### 2. Main content on the PTI page:
At first, you will notice a PTI banner within the main content taken from its original homepage.

On the PTI page, it presents a comprehensive overview of PTI, covering its founding principles, key milestones, leadership, policies, and challenges. It highlights PTI's vision for a corruption-free Pakistan, its contributions to the political landscape, and its ongoing efforts to address economic and social issues. The content also emphasizes PTI's focus on youth engagement and international relations, portraying the party as a significant force in Pakistan's political arena.

## Testing
The website has been thoroughly tested across a variety of devices and screen sizes, including a 21.5-inch monitor, a 15-inch laptop screen, an iPad, and several Android devices. It performs smoothly and generates accurate results on all these devices without any issues. On a computer, the hover effect on the information cards functions as expected, the links navigate to the correct pages, and the submit button on the form page redirects to the form-dump page, where the appropriate submission message is displayed. Additionally, the social media links in the footer successfully open their respective pages in a new tab.

To ensure the absence of syntax errors, the website was validated using the W3C Markup Validator and the W3C CSS Validator Services for every page of the project.

## Bugs

Some bugs I came across during web designing. I added a video on all the different links. The issue with the videos was that they were overlapping the main content. The issue could be fixed with further investigation. However, due to the lack of time available, I decided to remove the videos from the final draft.

Below you can see the code:

#### HTML Code:

```html
<section class="video.left">
  <video src="./assets/videos/imran.mp4" title="Imran Khan Video" width="350px" controls>
  </video

>
</section>
```

#### CSS:

```css
.video {
  margin: 20px auto;
  padding: 20px;
  position: fixed;
  background-color: black;
  max-width: auto;
  border-style: groove;
}
```

## Deployment
The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps:

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/UzairKhan211926/Imran-Khan).
2. At the top of the Repository (not the top of the page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
3. On the Settings page, locate the "Pages" link on the left side, under the "Code and Automation" category.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch" or "Main".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
