##  Features:

### UI/UX:

####    1. Colour Scheme
-   This website has a contant color themes running through all the links. e.g., in
    the maine content: lightblue and silver. Ref block is grey, background is white throughout.
-   Font for body is Arial with fall back on sans-serif.

####    2. Typography

#####   1. Readability and Accessibility:
-   Arial is a widely recognized and legible font. It ensures that the content on the website
    is easy to read for most users, including those with visual impairments or using different
    devices.

#####   2.  Consistency and Universality:
-   Arial is a default font available on most operating systems and browsers. This ensures
    consistent rendering across different platforms, minimizing the risk of font rendering
    issues that might arise with less universally supported fonts.

#####   3.   Professional and Modern Appearance:
-   Arial is a sans-serif font known for its clean and modern appearance. It conveys a professional
    look suitable for a website dedicated to a public figure like Imran Khan.
    
#####   4.   Fallback for Compatibility:
-   Using "sans-serif" as a fallback ensures that if Arial is not available on a user's system, the
    browser will default to another sans-serif font that is available. This maintains the overall
    design integrity and readability of the website.

#####   5.   Load Time Considerations:
-   Arial is a commonly used font and may already be cached in users' browsers, potentially reducing
    load times compared to less common or custom fonts.

In summary, choosing Arial with a fallback on sans-serif fonts strikes a balance between 
readability, accessibility, compatibility, and aesthetic appeal, making it a sensible choice 
for a website about Imran Khan or any similar public figure.

### Existing Features:

####    1. Navigation Bar 
-   Along with the name of the website, the navigation bar includes the links to all the pages
    of the website i.e., Home, PTI, SKCMH & Namal College.
-   Through the navigation bar, the user can easily move around and take full advantage of all
    the features provided by the website. For user feasibility, I also fixed the nav bar so users
    can switch between the links without the need to scroll up to the top everytime.

## Testing
The website has been thoroughly tested across a variety of devices and screen sizes, including a 21.5-inch monitor, a 15-inch laptop screen, an iPad, and several Android devices. It performs smoothly and generates accurate results on all these devices without any issues. On a computer, the hover effect on the information cards functions as expected, the links navigate to the correct pages, and the submit button on the form page redirects to the form-dump page, where the appropriate submission message is displayed. Additionally, the social media links in the footer successfully open their respective pages in a new tab.

To ensure the absence of syntax errors, the website was validated using the W3C Markup Validator and the W3C CSS Validator Services for every page of the project.

## Bugs

Some bugs I came accross during web designing. I added a video on all the different links. The issue
with videos, they were overlapping the main content. The issue could be fixed with further investigation.
However, due to lack of time available, I decided to remove the videos from the final draft.

below you can see the code

HTML Code:

    <section class="video.left">
      <video src="./assets/videos/imran.mp4" title="Imran Khan Video" width="350px" controls> </video>
    </section>

    CSS:

    .video{
    margin: 20px auto;
    padding: 20px;
    position: fixed;
    background-color: black;
    max-width: auto;
    border-style:groove;
}
