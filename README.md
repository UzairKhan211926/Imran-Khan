political landscape.

##  Features:

### UI/UX:

#### 1. Colour Scheme
-   This website has a contant color themes running through all the links. e.g., in
the maine content: lightblue and silver. Ref block is grey, background is white throughout.
-   Font for body is Arial with fall back on sans-serif.

#### 2. Typography

#####   Readability and Accessibility:
-   Arial is a widely recognized and legible font. It ensures that the content on the website
is easy to read for most users, including those with visual impairments or using different
devices.

#####   Consistency and Universality:
-   Arial is a default font available on most operating systems and browsers. This ensures
consistent rendering across different platforms, minimizing the risk of font rendering
issues that might arise with less universally supported fonts.

#####   Professional and Modern Appearance:
-   Arial is a sans-serif font known for its clean and modern appearance. It conveys a professional
look suitable for a website dedicated to a public figure like Imran Khan.
    
#####   Fallback for Compatibility:
-   Using "sans-serif" as a fallback ensures that if Arial is not available on a user's system, the
browser will default to another sans-serif font that is available. This maintains the overall
design integrity and readability of the website.

#####   Load Time Considerations:
-   Arial is a commonly used font and may already be cached in users' browsers, potentially reducing
load times compared to less common or custom fonts.

In summary, choosing Arial with a fallback on sans-serif fonts strikes a balance between 
readability, accessibility, compatibility, and aesthetic appeal, making it a sensible choice 
for a website about Imran Khan or any similar public figure.

### Existing Features:

#### 1. Navigation Bar 
-   Along with the name of the website, the navigation bar includes the links to all the pages
of the website i.e., Home, PTI, SKCMH & Namal College.
-   Through the navigation bar, the user can easily move around and take full advantage of all
the features provided by the website. For user feasibility, I also fixed the nav bar so users
can switch between the links without the need to scroll up to the top everytime.

## Testing
The website has been tested on different devices and screen sizes, eg. a 21.5inch monitor, 15inch laptop screen, iPad and Android devices. The website runs smoothly and generates appropriate results without any issues. The hover effect on information cards work properly on the computer, the links take you to appropriate pages and the submit button on the form page takes you to the form-dump page with the proper message for submission displayed. The social media links in the footer open the associated pages in new tab, as intended.

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

-   [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) - [Results](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Ffarrukh-ahm.github.io%2FPortfolio-Project-1%2F)
-   [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - [Results](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Ffarrukh-ahm.github.io%2FPortfolio-Project-1%2Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en)

The website was also tested through Lighthouse on Chrome for its Accessibility Score.<br>

![Lighthouse Score](./assets/images-readme-file/Light-house.JPG)

## Known Bugs
On some iPhone devices, the buttons on the Form page do not display properly. This is mostly due to the higher pixel density on iPhones. Attempted to resolve this by using more media queries with different widths and webkit device pixel ratios, but it didn't work. It's difficult to properly fix this issue as it displays properly on Chrome and Firefox's dev tools with simulated mobile screens, including iPhone screens. However, upon deploying and opening the website on the actual iPhone device itself, it shows issues. This will need further investigation. No other known bugs were found after numerous testings.

## Deployment
The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/farrukh-ahm/Portfolio-Project-1.git)
2. At the top of the Repository (not the top of the page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
3. On the Settings page, locate the "Pages" link on the left side, under the "Code and Automation" category. 
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch" or "Main".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://farrukh-ahm.github.io/Portfolio-Project-1/) in the "GitHub Pages" section.
